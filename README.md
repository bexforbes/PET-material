Code for GEANT4 simulation of simple PET scanner geometry.

IN THIS BRANCH: An empty detector with a point source of positrons at its centre.
                Sensitvity is calculated.
                Output is in ROOT.
                
IF CHANGING THE GEOMETRY: Detector geometry should be changed in BasicPET.cc.

It is advisable to use the PATIENT branch for further modifications - scatter fraction and axial hit positions
have not been implemented in this branch.

GEANT4 basic examples and EdMedPhc code used as templates.
